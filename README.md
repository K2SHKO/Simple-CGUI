🖥️ Custom WinAPI GUI Menu

This project is a lightweight C++ program that renders a custom GUI menu using the native Windows API (WinAPI), without relying on external frameworks like Qt or ImGui.

✨ Features

🔹 Custom GUI elements – buttons, inputs, and panels built from scratch in pure C++.

🔹 Unique grid background – a grid system designed by @Ayksii, giving the menu a modern and clean look.

🔹 Lightweight & dependency-free – no third-party libraries, just pure WinAPI.

🔹 Readable codebase – easy to understand and extend for learning or experimenting.

🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to create a simple yet functional custom GUI system with WinAPI.

It can be used as a learning resource or as a starting point for building more advanced UI components.
